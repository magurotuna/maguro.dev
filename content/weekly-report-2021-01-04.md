# Diary

I spent most of the 5-days new years holiday reading textbooks about programming and mathematics.

One book I finished reading was about basics of OCaml. I had been interested in OCaml for a long time but there was no chance to get started with it. Finally I started it in this holiday. The reason I'm interested in OCaml is that it is often used in the academic fields of programming or computer science. Particularly, when it comes to computer science that is closely related to mathematics, functional programming languages, including OCaml, seem to be the "first citizen". If I wants to learn academic studies about theoretical domain, that means I must understand OCaml. That's why I decided to read ["プログラミングの基礎"](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/478191160). It was a really nice book - I got used to OCaml well. I also learned that OCaml had great effect on Rust.

The second one is more about mathematics. The more I want to learn about programming theory, The more "mathematical" what I need to know gets. That said, I have to be familiar with "logic" in order to learn program semantics, type theory, etc. I finished reading ["論理と集合から始める数学の基礎"](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4535784728), and then, I'm reading ["情報科学における論理"](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4535608148). While the former is not so hard to read, the latter is sooooooo difficult for me that I understand no more than 30% of it. If I spend all the day reading it, there is few progress. I will never give up even though it will probably take much time to read through and understand it.

I also go on reading two famous compiler books, "the Dragon Book" and "the Tiger Book". Neither of them require the knowledge of difficult mathematics, which makes me feel kind of comfortable with them.
