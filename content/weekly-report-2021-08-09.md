No contributions this week. I was tied with other works, which prevented me from doing OSS.

# Diary

I have written an article about Deno to the tech magazine "WEB+DB PRESS" which will be published on August 23rd, and its cover has been released.

This article describes (1) the introduction of Deno, (2) the features of Deno compared in contrast with Node.js, (3) the basic web server development in Deno. I suppose that main target of this article is those who have slight experience of writing Node.js but haven't used Deno yet. Please check it out!
