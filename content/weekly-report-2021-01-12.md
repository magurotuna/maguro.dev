# Diary

I've started to work on Advent of Code 2020 in order to get used to OCaml better. It is fun to solve it in OCaml, but sometimes I feel like using Rust instead. I'm sure that this kind of pain will disappear as I write more OCaml code. I'd be happy if I could learn a lot from OCaml because it will lead to my higher skills at programming.
