# Diary

My move to new house is coming nearly - this weekend! I'm really looking forward to it.

I purchased an ultra wide screen monitor made by DELL. It has 38 inch, WQHD+ (3840 x 1600) resolution. The monitor I'm using right now is 4K, but just 27 inch. I'm sure the next one will allow me to work on everything even more efficiently.

Unfortunately, it will arrive in the middle of April. I can't wait for it!
