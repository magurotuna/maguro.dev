# About me

I'm a software engineer working at a company in Japan.

I want to become a software engineer who develops something used throughout the world and has great influence on the community.

I'm an enthusiast for the Rust programming language. I write Rust for competitive programming and for contributing to OSS. Currently, I'm very interested in developing software from low-level (e.g., OS) to high-level (e.g., Web server).
Besides, I have recently got interested in functional programming languages such as Haskell or OCaml.

# Skillset

- Rust
  - Although I haven't ever used it as a professional, it is the Rust lang that I feel most familiar with because I use it in most of my spare time.
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- Go
- React
- Vue.js
- Python
- PHP (Laravel)

# OSS Contributions
