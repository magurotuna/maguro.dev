# Diary

I joined the GitHub sponshorship program. I had thought few people would sponsor me, but surprisingly I've got as many as four sponsors! Fantastic!

My OSS contributions are just for my fun. But I'm very delighted to know my work is so valuable that I can get sponsors. I hope I'll return the favor to the OSS community!
