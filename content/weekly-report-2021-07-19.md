# Weekly contributions

# [denoland/deno_lint](https://github.com/denoland/deno_lint)

- [fix(ban-types): suggest `Record<string, never>` when encountering `{}`](https://github.com/denoland/deno_lint/pull/778)
- [docs(no-prototype-builtins): add doc](https://github.com/denoland/deno_lint/pull/771)

I was pretty busy with writing last week. Writing is almost done, so I'll gradually go back to work for OSS the next week.
