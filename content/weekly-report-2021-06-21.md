# Diary

Japan is in a rainy season now. When it rains outside I feel a little gloomy, but not everything is bad. Last Sunday, I went for a walk around my town and happened to visit a shrine, where I felt a bit colder and less humid than outside. There were almost no one but me, everything covered in silence. I felt as if I was not in Tokyo.

As I walk forward, very beautiful flower "Ajisai" ("hydrangea" in English) appeared. I couldn't help taking photos of it. The flower made me think that there are a few good things even in a rainy season.
