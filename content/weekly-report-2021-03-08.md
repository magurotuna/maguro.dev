# Diary

I decided what chair I was going to buy. Last weekend I went to a furniture store in Shinjuku to try to sit in various chairs. I liked a lot of chairs, and I thought they all worth getting it. Of those, I loved two chairs - ["Ergo Human Pro"](https://www.ergohuman.jp/product/ergohuman_pro.php) and ["Contessa II"](https://www.okamura.co.jp/product/seating/contessa_seconda/). Although both were really really good, the former was far cheaper than the latter, so I decided to get the former one. It's going to be shipped to my new house. I'm really looking forward to it.
