# Diary

Last Friday, I saw people who entered my previous company at the same time as me (we call it "douki" in Japanese) for the first time in a while, and had a dinner together.

This was meant to be a precious meeting of us during the COVID-19 times as well as my farewell party.

In my previous company, all employees have been working from home since March, so only by chat and zoom could we communicate eath other.

As far as I know, unlike other countries, most Japanese people think of "douki" as the one of most precious things in life. I confirmed this fact again through the party.

Although I've moved to the other company, I hope we will keep good relationship forever.

"Congrats on changing jobs!" is written on the dish.
